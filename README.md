# Bcs-Thesis-Dance-Performance-Evaluation

This Github repository contains the code used for the data pre-processing and model development for dance performance evaluation for my bachelor's thesis.

## Pre-processing
Consists of score data extraction (score__extraction.ipynb) and skeletal data extraction (skeletal_extraction.ipynb).
NOTE: Original recordings used in this code are not available in this repository.

## Machine Learning Models
Consist of K-NN, SVM and MLP models (machine_learning.ipynb).
CSV files used in this notebook are available in the 'Experiment Dances'  and 'Experiment Scores' folders.
